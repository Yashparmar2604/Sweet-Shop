# üç¨ Sweet Shop Management System

A JavaScript-based sweet shop inventory management system built using **Node.js** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with **Jest**.

This system allows users to manage sweets by performing operations such as adding, deleting, viewing, searching, sorting, purchasing, and restocking. The development process strictly follows the **three laws of TDD** and clean coding practices.

## üß™ Test Report

- All features were implemented using **TDD**.
- Test cases were written **before** implementation, strictly following the **three laws of TDD**:
  1. Write a failing test before writing production code.
  2. Write only enough of a test to fail.
  3. Write only enough production code to make the test pass.
- Edge cases and validation checks are included in the test suite.
- To view test coverage, run:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```
